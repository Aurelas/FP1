# Final Project Assignment 1: Exploration (FP1)
DUE --tbd--

Full assignment specification and schedule is [here][schedule]

Write your report right in this file. Instructions are below. Delete the instructions when you are done. Also delete all my explanation (this stuff), as I've already read it.

You are allowed to change/delete anything in this file to make it into your report. It will be public, FYI.

This file is formatted with the [**markdown** language][markdown], so take a glance at how that works.

This file IS your report for the assignment, including code and your story.

Code is super easy in markdown, which you can easily do inline `(require net/url)` or do in whole blocks:
```
#lang racket

(require net/url)

(define myurl (string->url "http://www.cs.uml.edu/"))
(define myport (get-pure-port myurl))
(display-pure-port myport)
```

### My Library: (library name here)
Write what you did!
Remember that this report must include:

* a narrative of what you did
* the code that you wrote
* output from your code demonstrating what it produced
* any diagrams or figures explaining your work

The narrative itself should be no longer than 350 words. Yes, you can add more files and link or refer to them. This is github, handling files is awesome and easy!

Ask questions publicly in the email group.

### How to Do and Submit this assignment

1. To start, [**fork** this repository][forking]. 
  2. (This assignment is just one README.md file, so you can edit it right in github if you like)
1. Modify the README.md file and [**commit**][ref-commit] changes to complete your solution.
1. [**Push**][ref-push]/sync the changes up to your GitHub (skip this if you didn't clone)
